## Description
An immersive ATC Implementation for DCS.
*BATC* aims to replace the the DCS integrated ATC completely, by handling traffic in a completely new, more realistic way. Unlike the inbuilt ATC, *BATC* keeps track of all aircrafts on the map by storing information about their
* Location
* Airspeed
* Flight Path
* Formation 

This enables it, to feature more accurate systems, for example the clearance to certain Flight Levels. A full feature list can be found below. Additionally it utilizes *VOSK* to enable speech to text input, without the need to pay for an application like VoiceAttack or a dedicated server, as *VOSK* can be run completly local. It also steps away from the traditional approachh of a set list of allowed commands/requests, by letting an AI interpret the natural input, which allows for a more approachable way of using ATC, as you aren't required to remember every command word by word.
